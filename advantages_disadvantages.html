                <h3 class="subtitle">Simultaneous Operations</h3>
                <p>
                    Quantum computers can perform multiple simultaneous operations due to the properties of quantum
                    physics, specifically superposition and entanglement. Superposition allows a quantum bit (qubit) to
                    exist in multiple states simultaneously, while entanglement allows two or more qubits to be
                    'connected' in such a way that the state of each qubit is affected by the others.
                    <br><br>
                    This allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers
                    by taking advantage of the ability to exist in multiple states simultaneously. For example, if a
                    classical computer were to search a database for a specific entry, it would have to check each entry
                    one at a time. A quantum computer, on the other hand, could check all entries simultaneously.
                    <br><br>
                    (Note: This is extremely simplified. The actual process if much more complicated and involves a lot
                    more science.)

                <h3 class="subtitle">Decision Problems: P vs BQP vs NP</h3>
                <p>Another advantage of quantum computers is that they can solve certain problems much more efficently
                    than regular computers such as finding the prime factors of large numbers (using Shor's algorithm).

                <p>In the diagram, overlapping areas represent problems in more than one category.<br> Eg. All
                    Polynomial time problems can be solve efficiently by quantum computers. The overlap between BQP and
                    NP means that quantum computers can solve some NP problems quickly (such as prime factorization).
