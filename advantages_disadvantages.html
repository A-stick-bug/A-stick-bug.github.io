                <h3 class="subtitle">Simultaneous Operations</h3>
                <p>
                    Quantum computers can perform multiple simultaneous operations due to the properties of quantum
                    physics, specifically superposition and entanglement. Superposition allows a quantum bit (qubit) to
                    exist in multiple states simultaneously, while entanglement allows two or more qubits to be
                    'connected' in such a way that the state of each qubit is affected by the others.
                    <br><br>
                    This allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers
                    by taking advantage of the ability to exist in multiple states simultaneously. For example, if a
                    classical computer were to search a database for a specific entry, it would have to check each entry
                    one at a time. A quantum computer, on the other hand, could check all entries simultaneously.
                    <br><br>
                    (Note: This is extremely simplified. The actual process if much more complicated and involves a lot
                    more science.)

                <h3 class="subtitle">Decision Problems: P vs BQP vs NP</h3>
                <p>Another advantage of quantum computers is that they can solve certain problems much more efficently
                    than regular computers such as finding the prime factors of large numbers (using Shor's algorithm).

                <ol>
                    <li>Quantum bits (qubits) are used instead of classical bits.</li>
                    <li>Qubits can exist in multiple states at once (superposition), which allows them to perform
                        multiple operations simultaneously.</li>
                    <li>As a result, there are many more possible states with qubits compared to regular bits.</li>
                    <li>Qubits can be entangled with each other, meaning the state of one qubits depends on the state of
                        another.</li>
                    <li>As more qubits are entangled, the ability of the system to make calculations grows
                        exponentially.</li>
                </ol>
