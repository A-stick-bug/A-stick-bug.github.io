                <p>
                    Quantum computing is a new field of computer science that harnesses the power of
                    quantum mechanics to solve problems that are too complex for classical computers. Quantum computers
                    use special units of information called qubits instead of bits that can exist in a superposition of
                    two states, allowing them to perform multiple calculations at once. They also exploit other quantum
                    phenomena such as entanglement and interference to speed up their operations, and have the potential
                    to revolutionize many areas of science, and technology. For example, they can be used in
                    cryptography, artificial intelligence, chemistry, physics, and simulations. However, building and
                    programming quantum computers is a challenging task that requires overcoming many technical and
                    theoretical obstacles, which is why they are not being used yet. In this website, you will learn
                    more about the basics of quantum computing, its applications, and its future applications.

                <h3 class="subtitle">Quantum Programming</h3>
                <p>
                    Quantum programming is the process of writing software for quantum computers. Quantum programming
                    languages are used to write quantum algorithms that can only be executed on quantum computers.
                    This is quite different from classical programming because quantum computers use qubits
                    instead of bits, which exist in multiple states at once and allow quantum computers to
                    perform multiple operations simultaneously. Quantum programming is still in its early stages, and
                    few quantum programming languages are available. Most quantum scripts are run on simulations rather
                    than actual quantum computers because of their high current operation cost.

                <ol>
                    <li>Quantum bits (qubits) are used instead of classical bits.</li>
                    <li>Qubits can exist in multiple states at once (superposition), which allows them to perform
                        multiple operations simultaneously.</li>
                    <li>As a result, there are many more possible states with qubits compared to regular bits.</li>
                    <li>Qubits can be entangled with each other, meaning the state of one qubits depends on the state of
                        another.</li>
                    <li>As more qubits are entangled, the ability of the system to make calculations grows
                        exponentially.</li>
